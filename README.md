# exercise-database-api

Hello! This REST API was created with Node.js and Express. The app is currently being hosted in heroku. 
Everytime there are changes made to this repository a 
new deployment is created. 

This REST API contains 898 gym movements it was created for a side-project that I am currently working on. 
Due to it only being used for a small feature on my application I have only defined the GET request.

The GET request comes from the following link: https://exercisedatabase.herokuapp.com/exercises which returns 898 movements.
The objects are in JSON format containing an id, name, and target muscle.

Due to this REST API being temporarily used for one feature it does not contain POST, DELETE, and PUT requests. 
In the future this REST API may get additional features added to it to continue learning REST API.
